# ISA-LC4-C-Programming-Project
This repo is one of my past course projects in C programming. In this project, I am building a LC4 assembler, disassembler, and simulator. 

## What is LC4?
LC4 is the assembly level "Computer" I aim to build which is of a memery of 64K. I was provided the ISA, and my goal was to build an object assembler, disassembler, and a simulator that operates the ISA operations.
